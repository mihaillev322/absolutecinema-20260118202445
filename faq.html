                        <h3>Do you offer video production services in my province (Ontario, BC, Alberta, Quebec, or Atlantic Canada)?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we provide cinematic video production services across all Canadian provinces including Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada. Our team travels with professional equipment to deliver consistent quality regardless of location. We have experience working in major cities like Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, and Halifax, as well as smaller communities throughout Canada.

                        <h3>What's included in your videography packages (filming, editing, colour grading, audio, and revisions)?</h3>
                        <p>All our videography packages include professional filming with 4K cameras, comprehensive video editing, professional colour grading, audio enhancement, and up to three rounds of revisions. We provide raw footage backup, multiple delivery formats optimized for different platforms, and professional audio recording with wireless microphones when needed. Our editing process includes music licensing, motion graphics, and title sequences as appropriate for your project. Colour grading ensures consistent visual style throughout your video, while audio enhancement includes noise reduction, level balancing, and soundtrack integration. Final deliverables are provided in formats suitable for web, social media, broadcast, or any specific requirements you may have.</p>

                        <h3>How far in advance should I book a videographer for an event or wedding in Canada?</h3>
                        <p>We recommend booking your videographer at least 2-3 months in advance for events and 4-6 months for weddings, especially during peak season (May through October in Canada). Popular dates like summer weekends, holidays, and conference seasons fill up quickly. Early booking ensures you secure your preferred date and allows adequate time for pre-production planning, location scouting, and creative consultation. For corporate events or commercial shoots, 4-6 weeks advance notice is typically sufficient, though we can accommodate rush projects when our schedule permits. Last-minute bookings may incur additional fees, and availability cannot be guaranteed during busy periods.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is your typical turnaround time for edited videos and highlight reels?</h3>
                        <p>Turnaround times vary by project complexity: event highlight reels typically take 5-7 days, corporate videos require 7-10 days, commercial productions need 10-14 days, and wedding films take 14-21 days. These timelines begin after filming completion and include all editing, colour grading, audio enhancement, and client revisions. Rush delivery is available for additional fees, with some projects deliverable in 2-3 days when necessary. We provide progress updates throughout the editing process and deliver preview versions for your review and feedback. Complex projects with extensive graphics, animation, or multiple deliverable formats may require additional time, which we'll discuss during the planning phase.</p>

                        <h3>Do you provide drone videography, and what Canadian rules apply to drone filming?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we offer professional drone videography services across Canada with fully licensed and insured operators. We hold valid Transport Canada drone pilot certificates and follow all federal regulations including flight restrictions, altitude limits, and no-fly zones. Our drone operations comply with Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) Part IX, and we obtain necessary permits for controlled airspace when required. We carry comprehensive liability insurance specifically covering drone operations. Before any aerial filming, we conduct thorough site assessments, check NOTAMs (Notice to Airmen), and ensure compliance with local bylaws. Weather conditions, airspace restrictions, and proximity to airports may affect drone availability, which we assess during pre-production planning.</p>

                        <h3>Can you help with scripting, storyboarding, and creative direction for corporate or commercial videos?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely! We provide comprehensive pre-production services including scripting, storyboarding, and creative direction for corporate and commercial video projects. Our team works closely with you to develop compelling narratives that align with your brand message and marketing objectives. We create detailed storyboards that visualize each shot, plan camera movements, and establish the overall aesthetic direction. Our scripting services include interview questions, voice-over scripts, and on-screen text development. We also provide creative consultation on location selection, talent direction, and visual style to ensure your video effectively communicates your message and engages your target audience.

                        <h3>What video formats and resolutions do you deliver (4K, vertical for social, YouTube, broadcast-ready)?</h3>
                        <p>We deliver videos in multiple formats optimized for your specific needs: 4K (3840x2160) for premium viewing and future-proofing, 1080p HD for web and general use, vertical formats (9:16) for Instagram Stories and TikTok, square formats (1:1) for Instagram posts, and broadcast-ready formats for television. We also provide YouTube-optimized versions with proper compression and metadata. All videos are delivered with appropriate codecs for different platforms: H.264 for web delivery, ProRes for broadcast, and platform-specific formats for social media. We include both high-resolution master files and compressed versions for easy sharing and uploading.

                        <h3>Do you travel for shoots, and how are travel fees calculated within Canada?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we travel throughout Canada for video production projects. Travel fees are calculated transparently based on distance, transportation costs, accommodation requirements, and crew size. For locations within 100km of major cities, minimal travel fees apply. Longer distances include vehicle costs, accommodation, meals, and travel time. We provide detailed travel cost estimates during the quoting process, so there are no surprises. For multi-day shoots or remote locations, we may require minimum project values to offset travel expenses. We're experienced in logistics planning and work efficiently to minimize travel costs while maintaining our high production standards. Remote location shoots often provide unique opportunities for stunning visuals that justify the additional investment.</p>

                        <h3>How many revisions are included, and how does the review/approval process work?</h3>
                        <p>All packages include up to three rounds of revisions to ensure your complete satisfaction with the final product. Our review process begins with a rough cut for overall structure and pacing feedback, followed by a refined version incorporating your initial comments, and finally a polished version for final approval. We provide secure online screening links for easy review and feedback collection. Revisions can include timing adjustments, music changes, colour corrections, and content modifications within the original project scope. Additional revisions beyond the included three rounds are available at hourly rates. We encourage detailed feedback during early review stages to minimize extensive changes later in the process. The approval process typically takes 2-3 days per round, depending on your response time.</p>

                        <p>Yes, we specialize in professional interview filming with broadcast-quality audio capture in various environments including offices, conference rooms, and event venues. Our audio equipment includes wireless lavalier microphones, directional boom mics, and professional audio recording devices to ensure crystal-clear sound quality. We conduct audio tests and environmental assessments before filming to identify and mitigate potential sound issues like HVAC noise, traffic, or echo. Our lighting setup adapts to existing office lighting or venues, creating professional, flattering illumination for interview subjects. We're experienced in working within corporate environments with minimal disruption to daily operations. Interview setups typically require 30-45 minutes for equipment preparation and can accommodate multiple subjects throughout the day.</p>
